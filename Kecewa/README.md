## Python

If you plan to develop your entry in Python you need to download and install the latest version of [Python]("https://www.python.org/downloads/"). You can develop the bot in either Python 2 or Python 3.

### Get the Code
Download the  [Zip file]("https://github.com/EntelectChallenge/2016-Bomberman/releases/download/v1.0.0/Sample.Bots.zip") from Github or user Git to clone the repository.</p>

* Start Git Bash
* Change to the directory where you want to checkout the sample bot
* Run:`git clone git@github.com:EntelectChallenge/2016-Bomberman.git`

### Setup Tools
If you wish to use 3rd party library dependencies you should include ez_setup.py from [SetupTools]("https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools") with your project.

### Compile
The easiest way to compule is to open a new command prompt in your bot folder and run `install -r requirements.txt`. This will use setup tools to fetch your dependencies.

### Run
The easiest way to run is to open a new commmand prompt in your bot folder and run `python botStart.py` where bot start is your bot python file.</p>
